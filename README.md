# rust-commandline-example

Example for building a command line application using Rust

You can start it using `cargo run` and then navigate to `Home` by pressing `h`, to the `Pets` menu using `p` and you can add random pets using `a` and deleted the selected pet using `d`. By pressing `q`, you can quit the program.

#### Notes about this project
This project is taken from [zupzup repository](https://github.com/zupzup/rust-commandline-example)
It supposed to be small toy to play along, so I would understand how tui is created
with ratatue lib. I plan to work on some issues that I would like to try.
